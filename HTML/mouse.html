    <p style="width: 70%; padding-top: 50px;">A computer mouse (plural mice, also mouses)is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of the pointer (called a cursor) on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer.</p>

    <h2 style="color: teal;">Description</h2>
    <p>A mouse typically controls the motion of a pointer in two dimensions in a graphical user interface (GUI). The mouse turns movements of the hand backward and forward, left and right into equivalent electronic signals that in turn are used to move the pointer.

        The relative movements of the mouse on the surface are applied to the position of the pointer on the screen, which signals the point where actions of the user take place, so hand movements are replicated by the pointer.[55] Clicking or pointing (stopping movement while the cursor is within the bounds of an area) can select files, programs or actions from a list of names, or (in graphical interfaces) through small images called "icons" and other elements. For example, a text file might be represented by a picture of a paper notebook and clicking while the cursor points at this icon might cause a text editing program to open the file in a window.
        
        Different ways of operating the mouse cause specific things to happen in the GUI: <br>
        
        Point: stop the motion of the pointer while it is inside the boundaries of what the user wants to interact with. This act of pointing is what the "pointer" and "pointing device" are named after. In web design lingo, pointing is referred to as "hovering". This usage spread to web programming and Android programming, and is now found in many contexts.
        Click: pressing and releasing a button. <br>
        (left) Single-click: clicking the main button. <br>
        (left) Double-click: clicking the button two times in quick succession counts as a different gesture than two separate single clicks.
        (left) Triple-click: clicking the button three times in quick succession counts as a different gesture than three separate single clicks. Triple clicks are far less common in traditional navigation.
        Right-click: clicking the secondary button. In modern applications, this frequently opens a context menu. <br>
        Middle-click: clicking the tertiary button. <br>
        Drag: pressing and holding a button, and moving the mouse before releasing the button. This is frequently used to move or copy files or other objects via drag and drop; other uses include selecting text and drawing in graphics applications.
        Mouse button chording or chord clicking:
        Clicking with more than one button simultaneously.
        Clicking while simultaneously typing a letter on the keyboard.
        Clicking and rolling the mouse wheel simultaneously.
        Clicking while holding down a modifier key.
        Moving the pointer a long distance: When a practical limit of mouse movement is reached, one lifts up the mouse, brings it to the opposite edge of the working area while it is held above the surface, and then lowers it back onto the working surface. This is often not necessary, because acceleration software detects fast movement, and moves the pointer significantly faster in proportion than for slow mouse motion.
        Multi-touch: this method is similar to a multi-touch touchpad on a laptop with support for tap input for multiple fingers, the most famous example being the Apple Magic Mouse.  </p>
