    <h2 style="color: teal;">Description</h2>
    <p>A computer keyboard is an input device used to enter characters and functions into the computer system by pressing buttons, or keys. It is the primary device used to enter text. A keyboard typically contains keys for individual letters, numbers and special characters, as well as keys for specific functions. A keyboard is connected to a computer system using a cable or a wireless connection.

        Most keyboards have a very similar layout. The individual keys for letters, numbers and special characters are collectively called the character keys. The layout of these keys is derived from the original layout of keys on a typewriter. The most widely used layout in the English language is called QWERTY, named after the sequence of the first six letters from the top left.
        
        Other sets of keys common to almost all keyboards are entering and editing keys (e.g., Enter, Delete, Insert), modifier keys (e.g., Control, Shift), navigation keys (e.g., arrows for up, down, left, right) and lock keys (e.g., Caps Lock). Additional keys are very operating system specific (such as the Windows and Apple keys).
        
        Most keyboards also include a set of function keys at the top (F1, F2, etc.). The function keys typically perform a very specific task within a particular software application. So, what they do may depend on what you are doing on your computer at the time.
