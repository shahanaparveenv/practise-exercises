<!--  c) Create two paragraphs and write some text about Front end and back end. -->
<p><b>Front-end development</b> focuses on the user-facing side of a website. Front-end developers ensure that visitors can easily interact with and navigate sites by using programming languages, design skills, and other tools. They produce the drop-down menus, layouts, and designs for websites.Front-end devs use computer programming languages like JavaScript, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to design websites. Each language serves a unique purpose. HTML lays out the site's content and structure, CSS adds design features, and JavaScript creates advanced interactive features. Less commonly, front-end devs know other programming languages like Python, PHP, or Ruby.These developers need expertise using frameworks and libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, and EmberJS. Frameworks ensure that content appears correctly on all devices, while libraries condense code into smaller, time-saving packages. Front-end devs may also use graphic design programs like Photoshop or Sketch, along with code editing tools like Notepad or Eclipse.Front-end development requires technical expertise and creativity to ensure websites' user interfaces look correct and function properly. Front-end devs work with back-end developers, designers, and user experience analysts.A front-end developer typically needs a bachelor's degree in web design, programming, computer science, or graphic design. Some individuals develop these skills through previous work, coding bootcamps, or projects to find employment without pursuing formal education.</p>
<p><b>Back-end developers</b> focus on the server side of websites. They use technical skills to perform the behind-the-scenes work that creates a website's structure and overall functionality, allowing a site's front end to exist. These professionals create a site's operations, databases, and application programming interface (API).The back end includes an application, server, and database. Computer users often do not see the elements of back-end development, which remain below the hood of a website.Back-end developers need advanced experience in server-side programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby to build applications. Students can learn or brush up on specific computer programming languages by completing bootcamps. For example, see our page on the best Python bootcamps.Back-end devs use tools like SQL Server and Oracle to store, organize, and change data. Employers often require expertise with PHP frameworks, version control software, and debugging back-end systems and applications. Back-end devs collaborate with front-end developers, management, and business stakeholders to understand each project's goals.Most employers require back-end devs to hold bachelor's degrees in computer science, programming, or web development. Some back-end devs can find employment without earning four-year degrees by learning through relevant work experience or bootcamps.With additional training, education, or certifications, some back-end developers can translate their experience into higher-paying careers as software engineers.</p>
