    <p style="width: 50%; padding-top: 50px;">In the field of computing, a printer is considered a peripheral device that serves the purpose of creating a permanent representation of text or graphics, usually on paper. While the majority of outputs produced by printers are readable by humans, there are instances where barcode printers have found a utility beyond this traditional use.[1] Different types of printers are available for use, including inkjet printers, thermal printers, laser printers, and 3D printers.</p>

    <p>Printers are one of the common computer peripheral devices that can be classified into two categories that are 2D and 3D printers. The 2D printers are used to print text and graphics on a paper, and 3D printers are used to create three dimensional physical objects.</p>
