    <p style="width: 50%; padding-top: 50px;">A plotter is a printer that interprets commands from a computer to make line drawings on paper with one or more automated pens. Unlike a regular printer, a plotter can draw continuous point-to-point lines directly from vector graphic files or commands.</p>

    <h2 style="color: teal;">Description</h2>
    <p>Types of plotters include the following:

        Drum plotters, which draw on paper wrapped around a drum that turns to produce one direction of the plot while the pens move to provide the other direction.
        Flatbed plotters, which draw on paper placed on a flat surface.
        Electrostatic plotters, which draw on negatively charged paper with positively charged toner.
        Inkjet plotters, which use inkjet printer technology and colored inkjet pens to deliver beads of ink in an assortment of colors to the drawing surface using vector graphic technology to move the pen plotters.
        HP is the leading vendor of plotters worldwide. Other manufacturers in this market include Canon, Epson and Graphtec.
